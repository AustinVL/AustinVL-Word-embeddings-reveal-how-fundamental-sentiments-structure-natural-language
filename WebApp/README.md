In this folder you'll find the scripts that make up the web application we used to collect the EPA ratings of our original dataset. For a general guide to hosting R Shiny application, see the R Shiny documentation (https://shiny.rstudio.com/).
As of now, the app has a couple of highly salient problems:
1. The app assigns concepts to participants completely at random. This means that the number of ratings per concept will be distributed randomly, meaning that some concepts will be rated more than others, which is not as efficient as if all words were allocated the same number of ratings.
2. The app loads the entire "results" Google Sheet into memory before assigning a participant to a new word. This wouldn't be a problem except that at a certain point, the file can become too big and the app might fail to run. To avoid this with the script as is (i.e. what we did to obtain the results we present), researchers must periodically clear the "results" Google sheet document and move it to another accesible storage spot, e.g. another Google sheet document.

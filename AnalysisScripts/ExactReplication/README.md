In this directory you will find Jupyter notebooks and Python files corresponding to the four studies described in the forthcoming version of the paper, as well as a copy of the US Online 2015 dictionary ("EPA_dict.csv"). Assuming the latter is in the same directory, each Python script and Jupyter notebook should run without error, assuming the necessary dependencies are available.

Unfortunately, getting TF (used in Study 4) to work on many machines can be troublesome. This code was ran on Google Colab. That notebook is publicly available here: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1RA1bSo_CnPJwcJVuUtMI2toyPr4wKt4Q?usp=sharing

Find here anlysis scripts in both a Jupyter notebook and a regular Python file. Both use Python3. Both should run without any errors, assuming the following conditions are true:
1. All the relevant libraries are downloaded onto your machine (see the first block of code)
2. All the relevant GloVe files are downloaded onto your machine in the current directory (see https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/)
3. You have sufficient memory. The current approach in these scripts is to load all of the distributed representation libraries into memory, which is pretty memory intensive.

Find here all of the data and scripts necessary to replicate all analyses in the paper. In the main directory, you'll find two primary directories, **first analysis** and **ACTReplicationPackage**. The former builds the EPA prediction algorithm, evaluates its performance on a held-out portion of the 2015 Online Dictionary, generates a new list of concepts, and outputs predictions for those concepts, while the latter assesses this algorithm's performance on a newly collected EPA dictionary and assesses consistency in ratings from the 2015 Online Data and data collected with our web application.
